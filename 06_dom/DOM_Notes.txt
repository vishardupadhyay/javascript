1. The difference between innerText and innerContent is that
    - innerText only contains the text which is visible.
    - innerContent contains the complete text, which may be invisible due to css properties.
    - innerHTML supports tags as well along with text.
2. document.querySelector('h1') - will return first h1 tag available in the page.
3. document.querySelectorAll('h1') - will return all h1 tags available in the page.
